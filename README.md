### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Martin Benndorf aka MiniDigger, a random guy from the internet, doing java and stuff.  

I like to drink beer and write code, sometimes to even do both at the same time! You can fund that little hobby of mine [here](https://github.com/sponsors/MiniDigger).

Some of my projects include Paper, or more specifically, Hangar, a plugin repository for the Minecraft server software Paper, various stuff for the irc client TheLounge, and a few toy projects with godot, check them out in the pins below!
